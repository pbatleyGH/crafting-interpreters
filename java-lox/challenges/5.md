# 5.1 - refactor:

I'm fairly confident that the grammar encodes a function call with optional chaining (as well as trivially, a plain number or identifier).

Some valid examples (I think):

- 100
- thing
- thing()
- thing(100)
- thing(1,2,3)
- thing(1,2,3).data
- thing(inner(10), 20)
- stuff.thing(a,b).other(c,d).final().data.data.split()

My attempt:

```
expr -> expr ( "(" ( expr (", expr")* )? ")" | "." IDENTIFIER )+
    | IDENTIFIER
    | NUMBER

expr -> NUMBER
expr -> IDENTIFIER
expr -> expr call
expr -> expr call chainExpr

chainExpr -> "." IDENTIFIER
chainExpr -> "." IDENTIFIER chainExpr

call -> "()"
call -> "(" param ")"

param -> expr
param -> literal
param -> param ", " param
```

My annotated solution [link](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/blob/master/note/answers/chapter05_representing.md):

```
expr -> NUMBER
expr -> IDENTIFIER
// the result of NUMBER | IDENTIFIER is callable
// but note: subsequent chained calls can't be NUMBERs, hence the need for the extra calls grammar
expr -> expr calls

// calls are chainable to any length
calls -> call
calls -> call calls

// call is all the things that can come after an identifier to 'act' upon it
call -> "()"
call -> "(" expr ")"
call -> "." IDENTIFIER
```

I was close...
But my chaining idea doesn't account for the fact that you can chain like: `func(10)(20)(30)`
